Description: Name/value pairs library.
  The libnv library allows to easily manage name value pairs as well as
  send and receive them over sockets.
Local Modifications:
  - Drop _KERNEL macroing, as this version is only ever in userspace.
  - Add extern "C" {} wrapper to header.
  - Support Linux credential transfer with struct ucred.
